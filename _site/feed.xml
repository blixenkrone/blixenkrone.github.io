<p>From top of my head, this will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Something with Go and Zig</li>
  <li>A project I wanted to try out with running k3s (Kubernetes for small places), storage and networking</li>

  <li>Setting up a DNS sinkhole with a raspberry pi</li>
  <li>Creating a Corne MX ergonomic keyboard from scratch</li>
