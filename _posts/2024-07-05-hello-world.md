<p>In this years' summer, I finally convinced myself to publish my sideprojects and tinkering as someone who enjoys software, coding and tech. </p>
<p>This will be my way of giving something back to the community, which has helped me so much in my own journey.</p>

From top of my head, this will be:

- Something with Go and Zig
- A project I wanted to try out with running k3s (Kubernetes for small places), storage and networking
- My switch from VSCode to Helix (with Zellij, fzf, ripgrep and yazi)
- Setting up a DNS sinkhole with a raspberry pi
- Creating a Corne MX ergonomic keyboard from scratch
